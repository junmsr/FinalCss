                    <p>Sleep Deprivation</p>
                </div>
                 <p class="description">Sleep deprivation is a prevalent issue among college students, impacting their academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. It occurs when a person doesn’t get enough sleep. It can be a short-term issue, affecting one or a few nights, or it can be a chronic concern that lasts weeks or even months. While there is broad consensus that insufficient sleep leads to a general slowing of response speed and increased variability in performance, particularly for simple measures of alertness, attention and vigilance, there is much less agreement about the effects of sleep deprivation on many higher-level cognitive capacities, including perception, memory and executive functions. This content explores the causes of sleep deprivation, its consequences, and effective prevention strategies.</p>
