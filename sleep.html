        <h1>Sleep Deprivation</h1>
        <p>College life is often associated with late-night study sessions, social activities, and irregular sleep patterns. Unfortunately, these habits can lead to chronic sleep deprivation.

        <p>Sleep deprivation among college students has become a widespread problem, with multiple reasons contributing to its prevalence. Students frequently sacrifice sleep in order to fulfill their duties due to the high academic workload, which is combined with extracurricular commitments and social activities. Furthermore, the college environment, with its crowded dormitories, noisy surrounds, and plenty of stimulating electronic devices, might disrupt students' sleep patterns.</p><br>
